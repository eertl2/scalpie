Bugs:
    -Bestbuy randomly selects people to do surveys, this crashes the code
    -Sometimes fails to click on element (hasn't happened in awhile)

main.py:
    -Check for multiple items
        -Check for multiple items, fire off a bestbuy.py object right before it goes in-stock (we know this because it says 'please wait...' on the item instead of 'Sold Out')

scheduler.py:
    -If a task fails, fire a new worker with the failed task

bestbuy.py:
    -Stop popups (sometimes an additional webpage opens, seems to be clicking on some address element...)
        -Loop through open processes after known problem comes up and close process?
    -Check for success
    -Take the attempt() method and put in into parent class maybe?
    -Check that price is target and not above (not the biggest deal atm, BB has 15 day return policy)
    -Spam click seems to bug out in headless mode but program still continues

worker.py:
    -currently only one buyer can go through at a time, implement executor to let multiple buyers purchase at the same time
