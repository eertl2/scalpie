Bugs:
    -Bestbuy randomly selects people to do surveys, this crashes the code
    -Sometimes fails to click on element (hasn't happened in awhile)

main.py:
    -Check for multiple items
        -Check for multiple items, fire off a bestbuy.py object right before it goes in-stock (we know this because it says 'please wait...' on the item instead of 'Sold Out')
    -Run program in background
        -Headless mode is implemented, is broken. Problems possibly include the queue system for bestbuy.py 

bestbuy.py:
    -Stop popups (sometimes an additional webpage opens, seems to be clicking on some address element...)
        -Loop through open processes after known problem comes up and close process?
    -Redo queue system and checks to be more robust
    -Check for success
    -Take the attempt() method and put in into parent class maybe?

Other:
    -Attempt to hide our webscraper (HUGE TASK but probably very important)

    -Include additonal websites
        -Amazon
        -Nvidia
        -Gamestop (I think you might need to be a part of their club)
        -(any website that sells gpus/ps5s/etc
    -CLI 
    -GUI
