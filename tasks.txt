Bugs:
    -Bestbuy randomly selects people to do surveys, this crashes the code
    -Sometimes fails to click on element (hasn't happened in awhile)

main.py:
    -Check for multiple items
        -Check for multiple items, fire off a bestbuy.py object right before it goes in-stock (we know this because it says 'please wait...' on the item instead of 'Sold Out')
    -Run program in background?

dbg.py:
    -Make debugger static

bestbuy.py:
    -Stop popups (sometimes an additional webpage opens, seems to be clicking on some address element...)
        -Loop through open processes after known problem comes up and close process?
    -Detailed fail message for which step was failed
        -Refactor the attempt method maybe? I made it to make code more consise but perhaps its not worth
    -Check for success

Other:
    -Implement multiprocessing?
        -Python's glv prevents multiple threads from running at the same time, making code much slower than it needs to be
        -Did implement communication between worker threads but the calls relating to threading.lock are worthless (i think) due to pythons GIL
            -Code would be worth if we could get multiprocessing working
    -Attempt to hide our webscraper (HUGE TASK but probably very important)

    -Include additonal websites
        -Amazon
        -Nvidia
        -Gamestop (I think you might need to be a part of their club)
        -(any website that sells gpus/ps5s/etc
    -CLI 
    -GUI
