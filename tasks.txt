Bugs:
    -Bestbuy randomly selects people to do surveys, this crashes the code
    -Sometimes fails to click on element (hasn't happened in awhile)

main.py:
    -Communication between worker threads to ensure only X amt of an item is bought
        -https://pymotw.com/2/threading/
    -Check for multiple items (Each item has its own webpage open)
    -Run program in background?

bestbuy.py:
    -When finding an element by ID, the last 4 numbers have changed
        -https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-locate-element-by-partial-id-match-in-selenium
    -Stop popups (sometimes an additional webpage opens, seems to be clicking on some address element...)
